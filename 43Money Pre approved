Last month, I found myself to have completely maxed out my over draft by the second week. I like to think this was through no fault of my own. After all, I had paid off my well deserved holiday to the South of France and had my car insurance renewal had been sprung on me as if out of nowhere! Unfortunately there was no way I could live to the end of the month and I wasn't willing to resort back to my student days and live on a diet of super noodles for 2 weeks. I must admit I started to panic and wasn't too sure how I was going to find some extra cash to get me through the month.

After doing a little research it was clear that millions of people find themselves in this position and like me, their predicament was far too short term to go to the bank for a loan. Extending your overdraft isn't always an option and savings are at an all time low given the current economical climate. So what options are you left with.
